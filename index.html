            <p class="hero-text is-light"><b>I'm an Iowa native who has spent most of his career designing and developing</b> for digital and print mediums for various organization across the world. I focus on making high-quality, content-focused, data-backed, responsive websites for the progressive web.</p>
            <p>As a former journalist and infographics designer, I enjoy breaking large problems down into small, bite-sized pieces helping my clients understand their user bases immediate needs while also imagining how they might push the boundaries and be truly innovative.</p>
            <p>I pride myself on solutions that are simple to use and elegant to experience. I listen. I reflect, amplify, and enhance the mission of your organization, your audience, and your specific project. To do this successfully, I use an agile approach, and a flexible attitude to maximize satisfaction and input. No problem is too small or too large.</p>
            <p>My most recent work includes a taking a telehealth consortium from JV to varsity (their words not mine), developing a strategy for and implementing a tool to validate content related to the ongoing health crisis, and helping a local non-profit enhance their digital presence. Have a look at a few case studies below.</p>
