		<p>I'm a design and type freak, who has an obsession with molding great user interfaces with the best experience, color and type possible. My passion for design is matched by only my love for Iowa Hawkeye football. With a background in newspapers and package design, I have developed a deep appreciation for all things visual. I approach each assignment the same: Design with passion and reason and the rest will fill itself in.</p>
		<p>I am currently the Design &amp; Experience Director for LaunchPad Lab, a Chicago-based development shop. I also help mentor UI/UX students for Bloc. Check it <a href="http://bloc.io" class="blue-link">out<a>. Follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtcunningham" class="blue-link">@kurtcunningham</a> or on <a href="http://instagram.com/cunningham_kurt" class="blue-link">Instagram</a>. I enjoy running, rowing and designing web applications, as well as, yelling at the TV during Bulls and Hawkeye games.</p>
