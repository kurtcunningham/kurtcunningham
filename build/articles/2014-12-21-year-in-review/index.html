Someone who doesn't reflect on the past and rarely thinks about what happened a day, month or year ago. But I am going to break that rule in this post. Why? Because 2014 was an amazing year. Not just for me but for all the people around me.</p> <p><br/></p> <h5 id=where-it-started>Where It Started</h5> <p>At the start of 2014 I was working at <a href="http://thinkcerca.com" class=blue-link target=_blank>ThinkCERCA</a> - an Educational Technology company - as their lead user expereince and user interface designer.</p> <p>In typical start up fashion, I was the middleman between the technology and marketing teams. Taking requests from both sides and defending each new feature with user interviews and the application's analytics.</p> <p>Tedious? Yes. Exhausting? Not at all. I certainly wouldn't say all of my role was normal for a one man design team, but this opportunity gave me insight into two domains I didn't have a lot of expereience in: Business development and project management.</p> <p>Additionally, it gave me the opportunity to drive the shape of a web application that provided a great service for its users.</p> <p>During this same time, I was running a freelance business - <a href="http://madebymunsters.com" class=blue-link target=_blank>Made By Munsters</a> - with a good friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/joeykirk" class=blue-link target=_blank>Joey Kirk</a>. I want to pause here and congradulate Joey on his new job during this timeframe. Joey is the UX Design Course Director at <a href="http://bloc.io" class=blue-link target=_blank>Bloc</a>. He graciously hired me as the course's first mentor.</p> <p>After about a year at ThinkCERCA and freelancing with Made By Munsters, I was ready for something new. A job that allowed me to build on my development skills and continued to shape the way users interact with web products.</p> <p><br/></p> <h5 id=the-start-of-a-new-friendship>The Start Of A New Friendship</h5> <p>Around the same time I started my search for new opportunities, Made By Munsters paired up with a small web development company, <a href="http://launchpadlab.com" class=blue-link target=_blank>LaunchPad Lab</a>.</p> <p>The Chicago-based development shop was formed by three Starter Leauge alum - Tom, Scott and Brendan. All entrepreneurs at heart. Who have one goal: Grow businesses through the use of technology.</p> <p>I had been doing freelance work for about a year now, but this was the first time I got the opportunity to work with a full-stack development team face-to-face. It was exciting and yet I was scared as hell.</p> <p>I say scared because one of the frist projects Tom approahced me to work on, Topstep Trader, came with a two week deadline. Not only did the deadline seem impossible for design work; I sold Tom on the fact that I could do the front-end development. I may have over sold myself. Full disclousure the current site/app is no longer our design. That's a story for another time.</p> <p>Though two-week sprints were nothing new to me; a two-week sprint for an entire application and marketing site seemed impossible. Additionally, I had to learn how to integrate static HTML/CSS into a Ruby on Rails application.</p> <p>The takes aways from this project: • Time boxing designs help a designer to focus on the most important details • The best way to learn something is to dive in head first • Refactoring saves lives</p> <p>After a few sleepless nights, the applicaton launched and to my amazement Tom called me to work on another project.</p> <p>Along with <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_p_francis" class=blue-link target=_blank>Ryan Francis</a> - LPL's first hire - Turfmetrics was born.</p> <p><br/></p> <h5 id=new-job-new-opportunities>New Job, New Opportunities</h5> <p>In February of 2014, I officially left ThinkCERCA and joined LaunchPad Lab full-time. I was the second employee hired and just the fifth member of the team. Once again, I was the only designer.</p> <p>But it didn't take long for our team to grow. In just a few short months, Dave Corwin was hired to help lead the charge with MD Anderson on our cancer research application. Another Starter League alum, Katie Astrauskas, was hired and then finally Monique Marchwiany joined the design team.</p> <p>Joining forces with LaunchPad Lab was the best choice I made in 2014. I have helped lead the design and user experience on 10 plus projects. Developed a deeper understanding of what it means to be a front-end developer and helped grow a business.</p> <p><br/></p> <p>A few projects from 2014:<br/></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://payvalet.io" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• PayValet</a></li> <li><a href="http://turfmetrics.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• Turfmetrics</a></li> <li><a href="http://OneParish.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• OneParish</a></li> <li><a href="http://ContentWeb.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• ContentWeb</a></li> <li><a href="http://Curefaster.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• CureFaster</a></li> <li><a href="http://shiftwomen.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• Shift</a></li> <li><a href="http://drinkgt.com" class=blue-link targer=_blank>• Greater Than</a></li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <p>Key learnings:</p> <ul> <li>• Modular Sass</li> <li>• Scalable Stylesheets</li> <li>• Accessible HTML</li> <li>• Responsible Responsive Web Design</li> <li>• Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js and AngularJS frameworks</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> <h5 id=whats-to-come>What's To Come</h5> <p>This coming year I personally want to continue to gain a deeper understanding of of Sass and responsible responsive design. Along with Monique and LaunchPad Lab, I want to push our perception of web design to break the traditional mold the web is becoming. Too often I see the same design from site to site sans the pictures and colors.</p> <p>I am excited to watch my good friend Ryan get married to his lovely fiancée. I can't wait to see what Joey's crazy kids - Henry and Emma - do; not to mention what <a href="https://twitter.com/bacunnin" class=blue-link target=_blank>Ben Cunningham's</a> awesome daughter Ellie will do this year.</p> <p>My good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/designhawg" class=blue-link target=_blank>Chris Courtney</a> is taking a leap. Leaving newspapers to join Joey at Bloc to teach the next great group of UI/UX designers. LaunchPad Lab is continuing its work with MD Anderson to tackle the problem of how to cure cancer.</p> <p>2015 will bare witness to many great events. As Tom would say, let's do this.</p> </main> <hr class=divider> <section class=page--section> <div class="page--container page-section--header"> <h4 class=title>Looking to get started?</h4> <p>Let’s set a time to talk.
