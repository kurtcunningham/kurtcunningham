This past weekend I had the pleasure of teaching a group of eager journalists at the University of Missouri about HTML and CSS. I couldn't have asked for a better group of individuals to work with.

The event, Society of News Design Digital Bootcamp, was a two day course designed to introduce the fundamentals of mobile-first development to journalists.  

This is the second time I have had the opportunity of teaching along side Chirs Courtney - [@designhawg](http://www.twitter.com/@designhawg) - at a SND Bootcamp.

One of the best things about teaching at these bootcamps is the people you meet. Having worked in the field of journalism for a few years before leaving for the tech industry, I cherish every opportunity I get to surround myself with talented reporters and designers from the industry.

After the first session on Friday, one of the attendees invited Chris and I out for a few drinks at a new brewery on campus - Logboat. Being a craft beer fan, I clearly didn't turn the invite down. 

In between rounds and before we ate more chili cheese fries than I care to admit, the student asked me a great question. She said, "Why do you do this? Do they pay you that well to come here and teach?"

My response, "I don't even know if I am getting paid." 

The truth, I told her, is that it took a good friend and even better mentor to get me to where I am today. I couldn't be more thankful for all the help Joey Kirk - [@joeykirk](http://twitter.com/joeykirk) has given me over the years. Had it not been for him, I wouldn't be able to get up in front of those students and talk about HTML or CSS.

I know what you are thinking right now, "OK, so the rest of this post is a thank you letter." Nope. That's not what this is at all. 

This post is the first I've made in years. I stopped blogging the day I left journalism, but that's changing today. 

Over the last few weeks I have been redesigning and refactoring my personal website. Using the new tools I have learned over the past year, my personal site is now hosted through Github Pages and built with Jekyll, SCSS and Bower.

By using Jekyll I gave myself the ability to create a simple, light-weight blog.

It is my intent to use this blog to share what I have learned over the years. Ask questions and be challeneged by my peers and those looking to get into the tech industry. 

This blog will focus on what I know. User-centered design, user interface design and clean/semantic markup. I hope that you are as excited about this as I am.
