This past weekend I had the pleasure of teaching a group of eager journalists at the University of Missouri about HTML and CSS. I couldn't have asked for a better group of individuals to work with.

The Society of News Design's Digital Bootcamps are a short two day course designed to introduce the fundamentals of mobile-first development to journalists.

These days are long. They are not easy. And they are full of frustrations. But I can safely say, the students who make it through this two day course wouldn't want it any other way.   

This is the second time I have had the opportunity of teaching along side Chirs Courtney - [@designhawg](http://www.twitter.com/@designhawg) - at a SND Bootcamp.

One of the best things about teaching these courses is the people you meet. Having worked in the field of journalism for a few years before leaving for the tech industry, I charish every opportunity I get to surround myself with talented reporters, writers and designers from this industry.

<blockquote class="lead-quote">&ldquo;All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not.&rdquo;

After the first session on Friday, one of the attendees invited Chris and I out for a few drinks at a new brewery on campus - Logboat. Being a craft beer fan, I clearly didn't turn the invite down. 

In between rounds and before we ate more chili cheese fries than I care to admit, the student asked me a question that got me thinking. She said, "Why do you do this? Do they pay you that well?"

My response, "I don't even know if I am getting paid." 

The truth, I told her, is that it took a good friend and even better mentor to get me to where I am today. I couldn't be more thankful for all the help Joey Kirk - [@joeykirk](http://twitter.com/joeykirk) has given me over the years. Had it not been for him, I wouldn't be able to get up in front of those students and talk about HTML or CSS.

I know what you are thinking right now, "OK, so the rest of this post is a thank you letter." Nope. That's not what this is at all. 

This post is first I have made in years. I stopped blogging the day I left journalism, but that changing today. 

Over the last few weeks I have been redesigning and refactoring my personal website. Using the new tools I have learned over the past year, personal site is now hosted through Github Pages, built with Jekyll, SCSS and Bower.

By using Jekyll I gave myself the ability to create a simple, light-weight blog.

It is my intent to use this blog to share what I have learned over the years. Ask questions and be challeneged by my peers and those looking to get into the tech industry. 

This blog will focus on what I know. User-centered design, user interface design and clean/semantic HTML and CSS. I hope that you are as excited about this as I am. 

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please reach out to be on twitter or email me at kurt@launchpadlab.com.

Time to get started.
