description: This past year - 2014 - brought on several new challenges. I saw myself leave one company, help grow another and picked up some new skills along the way. It was frustrating and exciting all at the same time. Here's why.

What a year 2014. 

I tend to consider myself a forward-looker. Someone who doesn't reflect on the past and rarely thinks about what happened a day, month or year ago. But I am going to break that rule in this post. Why? Because 2014 was an amazing year. Not just for me but for all the people around me.

<br>

#####Where It Started

At the start of 2014 I was working at <a href="http://thinkcerca.com" class="blue-link" target="_blank">ThinkCERCA</a> - an Educational Technology company - as their lead user expereince and user interface designer.

In typical start up fashion, I was the middleman between the technology and marketing teams. Taking requests from both sides and defending each new feature with user interviews and the application's analytics. 

Tedious? Yes. Exhausting? Not at all. I certainly wouldn't say this is a normal role for a one man design team, but this opportunity gave me insight into two domains I didn't have a lot of expereience in: Business development and project management.

Additionally, it gave me the opportunity to drive the shape of a web application that provided a great service for its users.

During this same time, I was running a freelance business - <a href="http://madebymunsters.com" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Made By Munsters</a> - with a good friend of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/joeykirk" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Joey Kirk</a>. I want to pause here and congradulate Joey on his new job during this timeframe. Joey is the UX Design Course Director at <a href="http://bloc.io" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Bloc</a>.

After about a year at ThinkCERCA, I was ready for something new. A job that allowed me to build on my development skills and continued to shape the way users interact with web products.

#####The Start Of A New Friendship

Around the same time I started my search for new opportunities, Made By Munsters paired up with a small web development company, <a href="http://launchpadlab.com" class="blue-link" target="_blank">LaunchPad Lab</a>.

The Chicago-based development shop was formed by three Starter Leauge alum - Tom, Scott and Brendan. All entrepreneurs at heart. Who have one goal: Grow businesses through the use of technology.

I had been doing freelance work for about a year now, but this was the first time I got the opportunity to work with a full-stack development team. It was exciting and yet I was scared as hell.

I say scared because one of the frist projects Tom approahced me to work on, Topstep Trader, he gave me a two week deadline. Not only did the deadline seem impossible for design work, I sold Tom on the fact that I could do the front-end development. I may have over sold myself. Full disclousure the current site/app is no longer our design. That's a story for another time.

Though, two-week sprints were nothing new to me; a two-week sprint for an entire application and marketing site seemed impossible. Additionally, I had to learn how to integrate static HTML/CSS into the Ruby on Rails application.

The takes aways from this project:  
  • Time boxing designs helps one focus on the most important details  
  • The best way to learn something is to dive in head first  
  • Refactoring saves lives

After a few sleepless nights, the applicaton launched and to my amazement Tom called me to work on another project.

Along with <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_p_francis" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Ryan Francis</a> - LPL's first hire - Turfmetrics was born.

#####New Job, New Opportunities

In February of 2014, I officially left ThinkCERCA and joined LaunchPad Lab full-time. I was the second employee hired and just the fifth member of the team. Once again, I was the only designer.

But it didn't take long for our team to grow. In just a few short months, Dave Corwin was hired to help lead the charge with MD Anderson on our cancer research application. Another Starter League alum, Katie Astrauskas, was hired and then finally Monique Marchwiany joined the design team.

Joining forces with LaunchPad Lab was the best choice I made in 2014. I have helped lead the design and user experience on 10 plus projects. Developed a deeper understanding of what it means to be a front-end developer and helped grow a business.

<br>

A few projects from 2014:<br>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://payvalet.io" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• PayValet</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://turfmetrics.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• Turfmetrics</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://OneParish.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• OneParish</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://ContentWeb.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• ContentWeb</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://Curefaster.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• CureFaster</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://shiftwomen.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• Shift</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://drinkgt.com" class="blue-link" targer="_blank">• Greater Than</a></li>
</ul> 

<br>

Key learnings:
<ul>
	<li>• Modular SASS</li>
	<li>• Scalable Stylesheets</li>
	<li>• Accessible HTML</li>
	<li>• Responsible Responsive Web Design</li>
	<li>• Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js and AngularJS frameworks</li>
</ul>

<br>

#####What's To Come

This coming year I personally want to continue to gain a deeper understanding of of SASS and responsible responsive design. Along with Monique and LaunchPad Lab, I want to push our perception of web design to break the traditional mold the web is becoming. Too often I see the same design from site to site sans the pictures and colors.

I am excited to watch my good friend Ryan get married to his lovely fiancée. I can't wait to see what Joey's crazy kids - Henry and Emma - do; not to mention what <a href="https://twitter.com/bacunnin" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Ben Cunningham's</a> awesome daughter Ellie will do this year.

My good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/designhawg" class="blue-link" target="_blank">Chris Courtney</a> is taking a leap. Leaving newspapers to join Joey at Bloc to teach the next great group of UI/UX designers. LaunchPad Lab is continuing its work with MD Anderson to tackle the problem of how to cure cancer.

2015 will bare witness to many great events. As Tom would say, let's do this.
